Election-Audit Summary:
        This script is a powerful way to synthesize often-complicated election data. The script is time saving and easily modified to fit any election data analytic needs. For example, the script can be augmented to take in more information on each ballot like time of day when the ballot was entered. This can be added by simply adding one list and an appending line in a for loop. Another example of the flexibility and power of this script would be the ability to determine how each candidate did based on each individual county and not just the overall voter count. To implement this addition the script could be run on a smaller subset of the data.
